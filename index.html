            all those working for us or under our control.<br>
            You are required to avoid any activity that might lead to, or suggest, a breach of this policy.
            You must notify your line manager OR a company Director as soon as possible if you believe or
            suspect that a conflict with this policy has occurred or may occur in the future.<br>
            You are encouraged to raise concerns about any issue or suspicion of modern slavery in any parts of
            our business or supply chains of any supplier tier at the earliest possible stage.<br>
            If you believe or suspect a breach of this policy has occurred or that it may occur, you must notify
            your line manager or company Director OR report it in accordance with our Whistleblowing Policy as
            soon as possible.<br>
            You should note that where appropriate, and with the welfare and safety of local workers as a
            priority, we will give support and guidance to our suppliers to help them address coercive, abusive
            and exploitative work practices in their own business and supply chains.<br>
            If you are unsure about whether a particular act, the treatment of workers more generally, or their
            working conditions within any tier of our supply chains constitutes any of the various forms of
            modern slavery, raise it with your line manager or company Director.<br>
            We aim to encourage openness and will support anyone who raises genuine concerns in good faith
            under this policy, even if they turn out to be mistaken. We are committed to ensuring no one suffers
            any detrimental treatment as a result of reporting in good faith their suspicion that modern slavery
            of whatever form is or may be taking place in any part of our own business or in any of our supply
            chains.<br>
            Detrimental treatment includes dismissal, disciplinary action, threats or other unfavourable
            treatment connected with raising a concern.<br>
            If you believe that you have suffered any such treatment, you should inform your line manager
            immediately. If the matter is not remedied, and you are an employee, you should raise it formally
            using our Grievance Procedure, which can be found in the current employee handbook.<br>
            This Modern (Anti) Slavery Policy and Statement is intended for use in all countries, especially the
            United Kingdom were R2R Care Ltd operates either through its agents or directly.</p><br>
            <b>Communication & awareness of this policy</b><br>
            <p>Training on this policy, and on the risk our business faces from modern slavery in its supply chains,
            forms part of the induction process for all individuals who work for us, and updates will be provided
            using established methods of communication between the business and you.<br>
            Our zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery must be communicated to all suppliers, contractors
            and business partners at the outset of our business relationship with them and reinforced as
            appropriate thereafter.</p><br>
            <b>Breaches of this policy</b><br>
            <p>Any employee who breaches this policy will face disciplinary action, which could result in dismissal
            for misconduct or gross misconduct. We may terminate our relationship with other individuals and
            organisations working on our behalf if they breach this policy.</p>
