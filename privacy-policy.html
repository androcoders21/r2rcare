              <b>Cookies</b>
              <p>22. A cookie is a small file that asks permission to be placed on your computer’s hard drive. Once
              you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyse web traffic or lets you know when you visit
              a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web
              application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering
              information about your preferences.
              <br>
              23. We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyse data
              about webpage traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to customer needs. We only use
              this information for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system.<br>
              
              24. Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website by enabling us to monitor which pages
              you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any
              information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.
              <br>
              25. You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies,
              but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent
              you from taking full advantage of the website.</p><br>
              <b>General</b>
              <p>
                  26. You may not transfer any of your rights under this privacy policy to any other person. We may
              transfer our rights under this privacy policy where we reasonably believe your rights will not be
              affected.<br>
              27. If any court or competent authority finds that any provision of this privacy policy (or part of any
              provision) is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that provision or part-provision will, to the extent
              required, be deemed to be deleted, and the validity and enforceability of the other provisions of this
              privacy policy will not be affected.<br>
              28. Unless otherwise agreed, no delay, act or omission by a party in exercising any right or remedy
              will be deemed a waiver of that, or any other, right or remedy.<br>
              29. This Agreement will be governed by and interpreted according to the law of England and Wales.
              All disputes arising under the Agreement will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English
              and Welsh courts

              time or as may be required by law. Any changes will be immediately posted on the Website and you

      <div class="modal-body">
          <p>Modern slavery is a crime and a violation of fundamental human rights. It takes various forms, such
            as slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory labour and human trafficking, all of which have in
            common the deprivation of a person’s liberty by another in order to exploit them for personal or
            commercial gain.<br>
            R2R Care Ltd has a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery, and we are committed to acting
            ethically and with integrity in all our business dealings and relationships and to implementing and
            enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure modern slavery is not taking place anywhere in
            our own business or in any of our supply chains.<br>
            We are also committed to ensuring there is transparency in our own business and in our approach to
            tackling modern slavery throughout our supply chains, consistent with our disclosure obligations
            under the Modern Slavery Act 2015.<br>
            We expect the same high standards from all of our contractors, suppliers and other business
            partners, and as part of our contracting processes, in the coming year we will include specific
            prohibitions against the use of forced, compulsory or trafficked labour, or anyone held in slavery or
            servitude, whether adults or children, and we expect that our suppliers will hold their own suppliers
            to the same high standards.<br>
            This policy applies to all persons working for us or on our behalf in any capacity, including employees
            at all levels, directors, officers, agency workers, seconded workers, volunteers, interns, agents,
            contractors, external consultants, third-party representatives and business partners.<br>
            This policy does not form part of any employee’s contract of employment and we may amend it at
            any time.</p><br><br>
            <b>Responsibility for the policy</b><br>
            <p>R2R Care Ltd has overall responsibility for ensuring this policy complies with our legal and ethical
            obligations, and that all those under our control comply with it.<br>
            R2R Care Ltd has primary and day-to-day responsibility for implementing this policy, monitoring its
            use and effectiveness, dealing with any queries about it, and auditing internal control systems and
            procedures to ensure they are effective in countering modern slavery.<br>
            Management at all levels are responsible for ensuring those reporting to them understand and
            comply with this policy and are given adequate and regular training on it and the issue of modern
            slavery in supply chains.<br>
            You are invited to comment on this policy and suggest ways in which it might be improved.
            Comments, suggestions and queries are encouraged and should be addressed to the Managing
            Director.</p><br>
            <b>Compliance with the policy</b><br>
            <p>You must ensure that you read, understand and comply with this policy. The prevention, detection
            and reporting of modern slavery in any part of our business or supply chains is the responsibility of
            all those working for us or under our control.<br>
            You are required to avoid any activity that might lead to, or suggest, a breach of this policy.
            You must notify your line manager OR a company Director as soon as possible if you believe or
            suspect that a conflict with this policy has occurred or may occur in the future.<br>
            You are encouraged to raise concerns about any issue or suspicion of modern slavery in any parts of
            our business or supply chains of any supplier tier at the earliest possible stage.<br>
            If you believe or suspect a breach of this policy has occurred or that it may occur, you must notify
            your line manager or company Director OR report it in accordance with our Whistleblowing Policy as
            soon as possible.<br>
            You should note that where appropriate, and with the welfare and safety of local workers as a
            priority, we will give support and guidance to our suppliers to help them address coercive, abusive
            and exploitative work practices in their own business and supply chains.<br>
            If you are unsure about whether a particular act, the treatment of workers more generally, or their
            working conditions within any tier of our supply chains constitutes any of the various forms of
            modern slavery, raise it with your line manager or company Director.<br>
            We aim to encourage openness and will support anyone who raises genuine concerns in good faith
            under this policy, even if they turn out to be mistaken. We are committed to ensuring no one suffers
            any detrimental treatment as a result of reporting in good faith their suspicion that modern slavery
            of whatever form is or may be taking place in any part of our own business or in any of our supply
            chains.<br>
            Detrimental treatment includes dismissal, disciplinary action, threats or other unfavourable
            treatment connected with raising a concern.<br>
            If you believe that you have suffered any such treatment, you should inform your line manager
            immediately. If the matter is not remedied, and you are an employee, you should raise it formally
            using our Grievance Procedure, which can be found in the current employee handbook.<br>
            This Modern (Anti) Slavery Policy and Statement is intended for use in all countries, especially the
            United Kingdom were R2R Care Ltd operates either through its agents or directly.</p><br>
            <b>Communication & awareness of this policy</b><br>
            <p>Training on this policy, and on the risk our business faces from modern slavery in its supply chains,
            forms part of the induction process for all individuals who work for us, and updates will be provided
            using established methods of communication between the business and you.<br>
            Our zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery must be communicated to all suppliers, contractors
            and business partners at the outset of our business relationship with them and reinforced as
            appropriate thereafter.</p><br>
            <b>Breaches of this policy</b><br>
            <p>Any employee who breaches this policy will face disciplinary action, which could result in dismissal
            for misconduct or gross misconduct. We may terminate our relationship with other individuals and
            organisations working on our behalf if they breach this policy.</p>
